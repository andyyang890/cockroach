name: PR Comment Addresser (Trigger)

# This is the first half of a two-workflow pattern to work around GitHub's
# restriction that secrets are not available to workflows triggered by fork PR
# events. This lightweight workflow captures the event context and saves it as
# an artifact. The handler workflow (pr-autosolve-comments.yml) is triggered by
# workflow_run, runs in the base repo context with full secret access, and does
# the actual work.

on:
  # Native GitHub review comments (inline code comments)
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
  # PR reviews (used by Reviewable.io - comments are embedded in review body)
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]

    # Only trigger for:
    # - PRs from the autosolver bot's fork (security: prevents force-push to other branches)
    # - PRs with 'o-autosolver' label
    # - Comments/reviews NOT from the bot itself
    # - For review_comment events: comments NOT containing our response marker
    # - For review events: only COMMENTED or CHANGES_REQUESTED (not APPROVED/DISMISSED)
